## Windows One-Click Start

From the project root, double-click:

```bat
start-litflow.bat
```

Or run in PowerShell:

```powershell
.\start-litflow.bat
```

The script opens separate terminal windows for the backend and frontend.

- Backend docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- Frontend app: `http://localhost:5173`

To stop LitFlow, close the two terminal windows or run:

```bat
stop-litflow.bat
```

The stop script prints safe stop instructions and does not kill ports
automatically.

## Start Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Backend URLs:

- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:8000/health`

Semantic Scholar API key:

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add:

```bash
S2_API_KEY=your_semantic_scholar_api_key
UNPAYWALL_EMAIL=your_email@example.com
```

Do not commit `.env`. It is already listed in `.gitignore`.

Semantic Scholar search API:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/semantic-scholar?query=flashattention&limit=5"
```

OpenAlex search API:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/openalex?query=flashattention&limit=5"
```

arXiv search API:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/arxiv?query=flashattention&limit=5"
```

All sources search API:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/all?query=flashattention&limit=10"
```

Unified search results include scoring v2 fields:

- `relevance_score`
- `authority_score`
- `frontier_score`
- `accessibility_score`
- `final_score`
- `venue_normalized`
- `venue_type`
- `publication_type`
- `publication_status`
- `rank_source`
- `rank_value`
- `rank_note`
- `venue_rank`

`final_score` is computed as:

```text
0.40 * relevance_score
+ 0.30 * authority_score
+ 0.20 * frontier_score
+ 0.10 * accessibility_score
```

`quality_score` is still returned for compatibility and is set to `final_score`.
`venue_rank` is also kept for compatibility and is set to `rank_value`.

Conference rank uses CORE-style `A*`, `A`, `B`, `C`, `Unranked`, and `Unknown`
categories. LitFlow first checks the local CSV file:

```text
storage/rankings/core_conference_rankings.csv
```

The CSV columns are:

```text
acronym,name,rank,source,year,note
```

The checked-in file is a small development seed, not a complete official list.
You can replace it with a complete CSV prepared from the CORE / ICORE portal.
When a venue is not found in the CSV, LitFlow falls back to its small built-in
mapping with `rank_source = LitFlow-fallback`. Journal quartile support is
SCImago/JCR-ready, but requires imported data, so journals are currently marked
`Unknown` unless local quartile data is added later. Preprint-only papers are
marked `Unpublished`. The system no longer uses `S` or `Journal` as rank values.

Search all sources and save results:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/all/save" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"query\":\"flashattention\",\"limit\":10}"
```

Legal open-access PDF resolver and downloader:

The system only resolves and downloads legal open-access PDF URLs from existing
paper PDF URLs, arXiv PDF links, or Unpaywall. It does not bypass paywalls,
logins, or CAPTCHA.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/resolve-pdf"
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/download-pdf"
```

Downloaded PDFs are saved with readable filenames when enough metadata is
available:

```text
{year}-{short-title}-{venue}-{rank}-id{paper_id}.pdf
```

Older files such as `storage/pdfs/1.pdf` remain valid and are not migrated.

Enriched paper display API:

These endpoints read saved database papers and compute display-only score and
venue rank fields at request time. They do not modify the database.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/enriched"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/enriched"
```

The enriched responses include `final_score`, `venue_normalized`, `venue_type`,
`publication_type`, `publication_status`, `rank_source`, `rank_value`,
`rank_note`, and compatibility fields such as `venue_rank`. These fields are
computed at read time for Dashboard display.

LitFlow also saves paper authors from search results. Authors are stored in
separate author/link records and deduplicated with a simple normalized-name
rule: lowercase, remove punctuation, and collapse whitespace. LitFlow does not
perform institution recognition or complex author disambiguation.

Single-paper export:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/export/markdown"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/export/bibtex"
```

Markdown export includes frontmatter metadata, authors, venue rank fields,
abstract, and the latest LLM extraction when available. If no extraction exists
yet, LitFlow still exports a basic literature-note template with "No extraction
available yet." in the structured summary sections. BibTeX export includes an
`author` field and produces a simple `@inproceedings`, `@article`, or `@misc`
entry based on the detected venue type. The Dashboard also provides `Export
Markdown` and `Export BibTeX` buttons in the paper detail panel.

In the paper detail panel, `Preview Markdown` fetches the Markdown export and
shows the Markdown text inside the page without downloading a file. `Export
Markdown` downloads the `.md` file and uses the filename from the backend
`Content-Disposition` header.

There are two export modes:

- `Export Markdown` / `Export BibTeX`: downloads files through the browser to
  the browser's default download directory.
- `Save to Library`: writes a local literature workspace inside the project
  under `storage/library/{paper_id}-{year}-{short-title}/`.

The local workspace contains:

```text
storage/library/{paper_id}-{year}-{short-title}/
├── paper.pdf
├── note.md
├── citation.bib
├── metadata.json
└── assets/
```

Workspace files are generated artifacts and are ignored by git.

Workspace API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/save-workspace"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/workspace"
```

Exported filenames use readable metadata:

```text
{year}-{short-title}-{venue}-{rank}-id{paper_id}.md
{year}-{short-title}-{venue}-{rank}-id{paper_id}.bib
```

Example:

```text
2023-flashattention-2-iclr-a-star-id1.md
```

PDF text parsing and RAG-ready chunks:

Run `download-pdf` first so `Paper.local_pdf_path` points to a local PDF file,
then parse the PDF and inspect the saved text/chunks.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/download-pdf"
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/parse-pdf"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/pdf-text"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/chunks"
```

PDF figures, tables, and unstructured assets MVP:

Run `download-pdf` first so `Paper.local_pdf_path` points to a local PDF file,
then extract page images and simple captions.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/extract-assets"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/assets"
```

Extracted assets are saved under:

```text
storage/assets/{paper_id}/
```

Page images are served from:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8000/static/assets/{paper_id}/page-001.png
```

This is an MVP. It supports page image rendering and simple `Figure`, `Fig.`,
and `Table` caption detection. It does not support OCR, precise figure/table
cropping, or multimodal chart understanding. Markdown export includes a
`Figures and Tables` section with extracted page images, figure captions, table
captions, and raw table text when available.

LLM structured extraction:

Run `download-pdf` and `parse-pdf` first so the paper has saved chunks. Use
`mock` mode to test the database flow without calling an external API.

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/extract" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"mode\":\"mock\",\"user_topic\":\"LLM inference systems\",\"max_chunks\":8}"

curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/extractions"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/latest-extraction"
```

For OpenAI extraction, set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env`. You can optionally set
`LLM_MODEL`; it defaults to `gpt-4.1-mini`.

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4.1-mini
```

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/extract" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"mode\":\"openai\",\"user_topic\":\"LLM inference systems\",\"max_chunks\":8}"
```

Single-paper RAG question answering:

Run `parse-pdf` first so the paper has saved `PaperChunk` records. The RAG
endpoint uses simple keyword retrieval only; it does not use embeddings or a
vector database.

Mock mode does not call any external API:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/ask" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"question\":\"What is the main systems optimization in this paper?\",\"mode\":\"mock\",\"top_k\":5}"
```

OpenAI mode uses `OPENAI_API_KEY` and optional `LLM_MODEL` from `.env`:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/ask" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"question\":\"What is the main systems optimization in this paper?\",\"mode\":\"openai\",\"top_k\":5}"
```

One-click paper processing workflow:

The workflow endpoint can resolve, download, parse, and extract a paper in one
request. Mock extraction is useful when OpenAI quota is unavailable.

Endpoint:

- `POST /papers/{paper_id}/process`

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/papers/1/process" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"resolve_pdf\":true,\"download_pdf\":true,\"parse_pdf\":true,\"extract\":true,\"extract_mode\":\"mock\",\"user_topic\":\"LLM inference systems\",\"max_chunks\":8}"
```

If you want to use OpenAI extraction, set `extract_mode` to `openai`. If OpenAI
quota or API access is unavailable, keep `extract_mode` as `mock`.

## Start Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend URL:

- `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

## Paper Dashboard

Start the backend first:

```bash
cd backend
.venv\Scripts\activate
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then start the frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open:

- `http://localhost:5173`

You can search papers directly from the Dashboard with the top Search panel.
For example:

- query: `flashattention`
- limit: `10`

The frontend first calls `/search/all` and shows results without saving them.
Select the papers you want, then click `Save Selected` to call
`/search/save-selected`. `Save All Results` is still available as a secondary
action and calls `/search/all/save`. Successful saves refresh the Dashboard
automatically.

You can also call the backend endpoint manually:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/all/save" ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"query\":\"flashattention\",\"limit\":10}"
```

The dashboard supports Search Only, Select Results, Save Selected, Save All
Results, paper filtering, PDF resolve/download/parse, mock extraction, one-click
Process Paper, loading the latest extraction, and mock RAG ask.

The frontend also includes a Literature Quality Board for reading triage. Each
paper is assigned a client-side reading priority: `Must Read`, `High Priority`,
`Frontier Watch`, `Skim`, or `Archive`. These labels combine rank, relevance,
authority, frontier signal, publication status, year, and final score. They are
an assistant for organizing reading work, not an absolute academic evaluation.

The paper detail Actions area includes an Extraction Mode selector with `openai`
and `mock`. `Run Extraction` and `Process Paper` use the currently selected mode.

The paper detail panel also provides a structured reading workspace:

- latest extraction displayed as structured summary sections
- PDF preview for downloaded files under `/static/pdfs/{file}`
- Markdown preview without downloading
- Markdown and BibTeX export buttons
